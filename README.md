# FluidTabAccessory

FluidTabAccessory is a lightweight UI library for iOS that brings an adaptive tab bar accessory to the tab bar.
As `UITabAccessory` in UIKIT and `.tabViewBottomAccessory()` in SwiftUI is only available on iOS 26.0 and later, this library aims to provide a similar experience, starting from iOS 15.0.

There will be 2 types of navigation available, `sheet` and `push`.
